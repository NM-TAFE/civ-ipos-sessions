## Lesson Duration: 4 hours

## Lesson Topic: Implementing 2D Data Structures in Python

## Objectives

1. Understand and explain the concept of 2D data structures in Python.
2. Learn how to create and access 2D data structures in Python.
3. Understand the concept of sequential and random access in 2D data structures.
4. Have a brief overview of Numpy and Pandas libraries in Python.
5. Apply the concepts learned to refactor a simple Python program.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

1. Define, describe and demonstrate how to create 2D data structures in Python.
2. Describe and demonstrate how to access data within 2D data structures using sequential and random access. 
3. Understand the use of Numpy and Pandas in creating and manipulating 2D data structures.
4. Refactor a simple program, enhancing its structure and performance using the knowledge gained.

## Lesson Structure

**Part 1 - Lecture:**

1. Introduction to 2D Data Structures:
    - Definition and overview of 2D data structures.
    - Examples of 2D data structures in Python (e.g., 2D lists, 2D tuples).
    - Discuss the importance of 2D data structures in real-world programming scenarios.
2. Creating and Accessing 2D Data Structures:
    - Demonstrate how to create 2D lists and tuples in Python.
    - Show how to access data in 2D data structures (indexing and slicing).
3. Sequential and Random Access in 2D Data Structures:
    - Define and differentiate sequential access and random access.
    - Demonstrate how sequential and random access are implemented in Python's 2D data structures.
4. Introduction to Numpy and Pandas:
    - Brief overview of Numpy and Pandas libraries and their importance in managing 2D data structures.
    - Demonstrate creating a basic 2D data structure using both libraries.
