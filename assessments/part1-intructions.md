# Assessment Task: Project KBA

> Maintenance of Open Source Projects

**1.** Identify an open source target program requiring maintenance.

- **Task**: Explore the open-source landscape and choose a Python-based project that you believe you can contribute to.
- **Instructions**: Provide the name and a link to the chosen project/program. Include a short justification explaining why you chose this program and how you believe you can contribute (broadly).

**2.** Establish and confirm the target program's requirements and specifications.

- **Task**: Focus on understanding the current state of the project and areas where there is a need for improvements.
- **Instructions**: Outline where you believe the core development focus is and why.

**3.** Examine online resources applicable to the target program.

- **Task**: Identify specific resources that are relevant to the chosen project, such as official documentation, forums, or community chat platforms.
- **Instructions**: Provide a list of these resources with brief descriptions of their relevance and how they can aid in your contribution process.

**4.** Set up the target project locally.

- **Task**: Instead of downloading binaries, clone the project repository and set it up on your local machine.
- **Instructions**: Describe the process you followed to set up the project, including any dependencies you installed. Highlight any challenges faced and how you overcame them. If you used instructions from the project's documentation, provide a link to the relevant section. If you did not, explain why you believe the project didn't have instructions for contributing.

**5.** Access and analyse the supporting documentation of the target program.

- **Task**: Dive deep into the project's documentation, focusing on setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and code of conduct.
- **Instructions**: Provide insights and key takeaways from the documentation. Mention any gaps or areas of improvement you identified.

**6.** Engage with the Open Source Community.

- **Task**: Join an online community or forum related to your chosen program. Initially, focus on passive participation to understand the community dynamics.
- **Instructions**: Provide screenshots or other evidence of your engagement. Reflect on your experience joining the community and any insights gained from passive participation.

**7.** Run the project locally.

- **Task**: Execute the project on your local machine, ensuring it runs as expected.
- **Instructions**: Detail the steps you took to run the project and any challenges faced. If there were deviations from the documentation or additional steps required, document those as well.

**8.** Analyse the project's issue database.

- **Task**: Explore the project's issues or bug database. Prioritise bugs or tasks labeled as "good first issues" or "beginner-friendly."
- **Instructions**: What system does the project use to track issues? What are some labels you identified that are relevant. Provide screenshots of the bugs and tasks you've identified. Describe your criteria for selection and any filters or tags you used to prioritise them.

**9.** Familiarise yourself with the project's development tools and environment.

- **Task**: Understand and set up any tools or environments essential for the project, such as virtual environments, linters, or testing frameworks.
- **Instructions**: Detail the tools and environments you used during this process. Highlight any challenges faced and how you addressed them. What CI/CD tools does the project use? What are the project's testing requirements? What are the project's linting requirements?
