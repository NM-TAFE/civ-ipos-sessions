# Assessment FAQ

**Q: Do I need to stick to the repository/issues I identified to pass the final assessment?**  
**A:** No, you don't have to stick to the initially identified repository or issues. However, it's recommended that you choose something you are likely to be able to complete.

---

**Q: How do I submit code to my project?**  
**A:** You must follow the guidelines outlined in your chosen application. Each open-source project usually has its own set of contribution guidelines, so make sure to read and understand them before making any submissions.

---

**Q: What if I am not sure how to submit code?**  
**A:** If you're unsure about the submission process, it might be an indication that you need to choose another project. It's essential to be familiar with the contribution process to ensure a smooth experience.

**Q: Can I submit code to a stale project?**  
**A:** Generally, no. Submitting to a stale or inactive project might not be beneficial as your contributions might not be reviewed or merged. If you believe there's a valid reason to contribute to such a project, you should have a clear justification and consult with your lecturer.

---

**Q: Can I work on multiple issues or projects at once?**  
**A:** While you can work on multiple issues or projects, it's recommended to focus on one at a time, especially if you're new to open-source contributions. This will allow you to give your best to each task and understand the nuances of each project.

**Q: What if I find the chosen issue too challenging to resolve?**  
**A:** It's okay to feel overwhelmed or find certain issues challenging. In such cases, consider seeking help from the community, your peers, or your lecturer. If it's still too challenging, it might be a good idea to switch to a different issue or project that aligns better with your skill level.

**Q: When will I have to evidence a contribution to the project?**
**A:** The project is divided into a KBA and a practical assessment. You will have to evidence your contributions in the practical assessment. The KBA is a written assessment that will test your knowledge of the open-source contribution process.

Remember, the goal of this assessment is to familiarize yourself with the open-source contribution process and learn along the way. Don't hesitate to ask questions and seek guidance whenever needed.
