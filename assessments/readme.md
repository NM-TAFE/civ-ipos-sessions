### Guide for Researching and Selecting an Open Source Python Project

#### 1. Define Your Interest and Skill Level

- **Why**: You'll best engage with a project that aligns with your passion and current abilities.
- **How**:
  - List your top 3 areas in Python (e.g., web scraping, game development, AI, etc.).
  - Assess your skill level: beginner, intermediate, or advanced.

#### **2. Dive into GitHub**

- **Why**: GitHub is the central hub for open source projects.
- **How**:
  - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
  - In the search bar, type keywords from your interests. Add `language:Python` to your search to ensure Python specificity.
  - For instance: if you're into web scraping, type "web scraping language:Python".
  - To see popular projects, click on 'Sort' and select 'Most Stars'. This indicates projects that many people found valuable or interesting.

#### 3. Filter with Labels

- **Why**: Labels can guide you to projects specifically seeking help from newcomers.
- **How**:
  - Once you're viewing a project, check its 'Issues' tab.
  - Use the ‘Labels’ filter. Look for tags like "good first issue", "beginner-friendly", or "help wanted".
  - Browse through these issues to see if you find them understandable and solvable.

#### 4. Gauge the Project's Health

- **Why**: You want a project that's active but not overwhelmingly busy.
- **How**:
  - Look at the project's main page. When was the last commit? If it's recent (within the last month or so), it's a good sign.
  - Check the number of contributors on the main page. Many contributors mean an active community.
  - Does the project have a well-structured README and documentation? This usually makes your entry smoother.

#### 5. Sense the Community Vibe

- **Why**: A welcoming community will make your contribution experience much more pleasant.
- **How**:
  - Go through recent issues and pull requests to see if conversations are respectful and collaborative.
  - Find the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (usually at the root or in a `.github` folder). This will give you a sense of the contribution guidelines.
  - Some projects have links to their chatrooms or forums. Consider joining temporarily to see how active and welcoming they are.

#### 6. Dive into the Code

- **Why**: A quick look can help you judge if the codebase feels right for you.
- **How**:
  - Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of the project page. This creates a copy in your GitHub account.
  - Clone this forked repo to your local machine. Browse through the code. Ask yourself: Do I understand this? Does the structure make sense to me?

#### 7. Compile a Shortlist

- **Why**: Multiple options will give you a backup if one project doesn’t work out.
- **How**:
  - In a document, list 2-3 projects that feel right.
  - For each, note down potential areas where you think you can contribute.

#### 8. Make Your Choice

- **Why**: Time to commit to a project and get started!
- **How**:
  - Reflect on your shortlist. Which project aligns most with your interest, has a good community vibe, and offers clear contribution paths?
  - Pick that project and get ready to delve deeper into it.
