'''Considering reuse (modularisation)
when creating python programs'''



# Additional activity - create a calculator class and re-use this by instantiating it in the main.py



# So as not to contaminate your global
# namespace, it is good practice to use a
# main function.


# so that we can reuse our code as both a
# module and a script
# we can use an if statement to ensure
# that some code is only executed when name is __main__
