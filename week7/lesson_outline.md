# Debugging and Documentation techniques

> ICTPRG443 – Apply Intermediate Programming Skills in Different Languages – Delivered as part of IPOS cluster

## Goals

- **Develop an appreciation and proficiency** in modern debugging tools for Python.
- **Implement consistent** and appropriate in-code documentation and set up document generation processes.

## Lesson Outline

### **Introduction to Debugging**

#### Definition and Importance

- What is debugging?
- Why is it essential in the software development process?

#### Debugging vs. Using a Debugger

- How the act of identifying and fixing issues differs from the tools that assist the process.

### Debugging Techniques & Tools

#### Methods Overview

- Print statements: Their uses and limitations.
- In-line inspection: A quick look at variables and flow.
- IDE-based debugging: Taking advantage of integrated tools.

#### Key Debugging Tasks

- Setting breakpoints.
- Stepping through code.
- Examining variables and call stacks.

#### Limitations of Debugging

- What debugging can't help with.
- Importance of good initial code design.

#### Hands-on Debugging Activity

- Practical exercise for students to apply what they've learned.

### Documentation in Software Development

#### The Role and Value of Good Documentation

- Why is it essential?
- How does it impact the software lifecycle?

#### Internal vs. External Documentation

- The differences and uses of each type.
- Examples of both.

#### Modern Practices in Documentation

- Evolving standards for internal documentation.
- How and why internal documentation is becoming suitable for external use.

### Documentation Generation

#### Tools for Automatic Documentation Generation

- An overview of popular tools.
- Advantages of automated documentation.

#### Manual vs. Automatic Documentation

- The pros and cons of each method.
- Situations where each might be preferable.

#### Sphinx for Python Workshop

- Hands-on practice with one of Python's top documentation generation tools.

## Expected Outcomes

- Be proficient in core functions of **PyCharm** and **pdb debugger**.
- Understand and value the importance of **documentation** and the convergence of internal and external documentation.
- Be able to **generate documentation** directly from code.

## Activities

### Debugging Activity

- **Debug a Buggy [Tic-Tac-Toe](activities/tic_tac_bug_toe.py)**
  - Work through a version of the game with intentional bugs. Identify, understand, and rectify the issues using debugging tools and techniques.

### Documentation Activity

- **Perform Documentation Workshop**
  - Follow the activities and lessons provided [here](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/). This will give hands-on experience in generating and understanding documentation.

### Relation to Unit of Competency (UoC) - ICTPRG443

This lesson is tailored to address key aspects of the UoC, ICTPRG443 - Apply Intermediate Programming Skills in Different Languages. Here's a breakdown of how the lesson addresses the performance criteria:

- **3.1 Use stand-alone debugging tools and tools provided by integrated development environment (IDE)**
  - Addressed in the section on "Debugging Techniques & Tools", emphasizing the use of IDE-based debugging tools and other stand-alone tools.
- **3.2 Trace code execution and examine variable contents using debugger**
  - Covered during the "Hands-on Debugging Activity" where students interact with breakpoints, trace code execution, and inspect variable values.
- **3.3 Develop and document maintainable code according to organisational guidelines and coding standards**
  - The emphasis on "Documentation in Software Development" underscores the importance of maintaining code with clear documentation, aligning with organizational guidelines.
- **3.4 Apply internal documentation to code using documentation tools available in target language**
  - Addressed in the "Documentation Generation" section, specifically during the Sphinx for Python Workshop, where students learn to generate internal documentation.

The knowledge aspects, such as development methodologies, programming methodologies, documentation techniques, and debugging tools and methodologies, are integrated across the lesson, ensuring students are equipped with both practical skills and the underlying knowledge.
