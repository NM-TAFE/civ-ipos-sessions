'''A buggy Tic-Tac-Toe game that provides an opportunity to debug code by both reasoning about it and stepping through it in a debugger.

The program has a number of bugs that are introduced one at a time. The goal is to find and fix the bugs.

Ensure you step through this program in an IDE debugger and pdb to understand how the program works and to find the bugs.'''
