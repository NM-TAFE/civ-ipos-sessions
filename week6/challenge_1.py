# # Challenge 1 - Instructions
# A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure that allows elements to be 
# inserted and removed from the same end, called the top of the stack. 
# Your task is to create a Python class named Stack with the following methods:

# __init__: Initializes an empty stack.
# push(item): Adds an item to the top of the stack.
# pop(): Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack. 
# If the stack is empty, it returns None.
# is_empty(): Returns True if the stack is empty, False otherwise.
