# Goal: Down the rabbit hole we go. By the end of the lesson, students should understand various data structures, their Python equivalents, and their relevance in modern software development.

## Key terms: Lists, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Sets, Hash Tables, User-defined data structures, Binary Search.

## Performance criteria: ICTPRG443, 2.3, 2.4

1. Introduction to Data Structures

- Define what a data structure is.
- Explain their relevance to modern software development.
- Give a brief overview of common data structures

2. Deep Dive into Selected Structures with Python

- Lists and Arrays: Discuss their similarities, differences, and built-in Python implementations.
- Linked Lists: Briefly touch on the concept of nodes and pointers.
- Stacks and Queues: Use Python's collections.deque as an example.
- Trees, DAGs, and Graphs: Introduction to the concepts and applications.
- Sets and Hash Tables: Show Python's built-in set and dict, and their common use cases.

3. Introduction to Binary Search

- Explain the idea behind binary search and its efficiency.
- Code our favourite guessing game!

4. Python's Language-provided Facilities for Sorted Data Structures

- Show the use of sorted(), sort(), bisect module, etc.
- Highlight Pythonâ€™s flexibility and power in handling sorted structures.

5. Short Activities

- Activity 1: Implement a basic stack using lists.
- Activity 2: Create a number guessing game and a super powerful AI that optimally solves them.

6. Work on KBA part 1 (90 min alloc)
