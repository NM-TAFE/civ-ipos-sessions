"""Demonstrates Unit Testing Concepts shown in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lfv5tUGsn8
We use an example of a function that calculates the area of a circle and show that it fails for certain input values.
Given this how do we scope what input values we want and how do we document and test that the function does all that we want it to do"""

# Will this function work for all values of r? Clearly not. An easy way to demonstrate this is to create a list with
# a set of values we want to test and then call our function with each of those values using a for loop like so: j in
# python is the same as i (imaginary) in maths
