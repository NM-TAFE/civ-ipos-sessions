## Activity 1 Instructions

- Using only required folder structure
- Write a function that calculates the sum of two numbers
- Call it add or add2, not sum (that is a built-in function)
- Include a docstring!

## Step 2

- Write the unit tests that check:
- that correct values are calculated for integer, floating point, and complex numbers (e.g., 2 - 1j is complex)
- that a TypeError is raised if any of the arguments is not a valid type
