# Lesson Plan: Unitesting

## Lesson Duration: 4 hours

## Lesson Topic: Unit testing, methods and mcoking
### Introduction to Unit Testing
- Definition and purpose of unit testing.
- Benefits of unit testing: improving code quality, easing refactoring, catching regressions, aiding in documentation, and providing a solid foundation for the software. 
### Fundamentals of Testing
- Test Cases: Individual units of testing. They check if a particular condition returns a true or false result.
- Test Suites: A collection of test cases, test suites, or both. Represents multiple test cases/suites to be executed together.
- Test Fixtures: Resources set up to run the test (e.g., database setup, mock objects).
- Test Runners: Orchestrates the execution of tests and provides the outcome to the user. 
### Introduction to unittest Framework in Python
- Part of the standard library.
- Follows the xUnit architecture.
- Optional contrast with assertions, doctest, pytest
### Writing Basic Tests using unittest
- Creating test cases by subclassing unittest.TestCase.
- Using assertion methods like assertEqual, assertTrue, and assertFalse.
- Setting up and tearing down tests using setUp and tearDown methods. 
### Practical Exercise: Writing Simple Unit Tests
- Task: Write unit tests for a simple calculator function (addition, subtraction).
- Participants will write tests, execute them, and interpret the results. 
### Test Discovery and Organizing Test Suites
- Using unittest's test discovery mechanism to find and run tests. 
### Mocking in unittest
- Introduction to the Mock class and its importance in isolating tests.
- Practical Exercise: Use mocks to simulate external dependencies for a function. 
### Best Practices in Unit Testing
- Writing clear, concise, and focused test cases.
- Ensuring tests are isolated and independent.
- Avoiding testing implementation details; focusing on behaviour.
- Continually running tests after each code change.
### Integrating unittest with Development Environments
- Using unit tests in popular IDEs like PyCharm.
- Introduction to Continuous Integration (CI) and how unit tests are crucial in CI pipelines.
### Summary and Q&A Session
- Recap of the main points covered.
- Open the floor for any questions and provide clarifications on the discussed topics.
### Transition to Part 2: Assessment Catch Up
